Train and run a model which can drive reasonably well in Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005)
## **Disclaimer**
The sole purpose of this repository is to provide the files from this project almost ancient project of mine. The project is from before I even learned about version control and other best practices in software development. The functionalities have not been tested since it was finished in early 2021.
Also, due to relevancy and the file size limitations, some files couldn't be included in this repository. Files such as the training data and the model parameters.
